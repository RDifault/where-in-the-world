- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind] (https://tailwindcss.com/) - For Styles

### What I learned

I've made this project to be slightly differ from the given design. One of the noticable changes is that in the original design, the flags are supposed to be shown fully in the card from edge to edge. But in my web, there are a wrapper for the country flags. This is done to respect each flag's aspect ratio, and to make it differ from another country's flag if there are countries with similar flags like Indonesia and Monaco.

But most importantly, i'm proud to have finished this project to deepen my knowledge in API calls, using React hooks, especially useContext, and routing using React-router. I've also learned how to filter and implement search bar in this project

### Useful resources
